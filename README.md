# CLI-Mini_Project-T.W-


# Project Description: 

The client has launched a pop-up cafe in a busy business district. They are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices. As such, they require a software application which helps them to log and track orders.

The mini project will run on the command line .The app will maintain a collection of products, couriers, and orders for a pop-up cafe.Utalising this through a simple navgation system that displays different menu options to the user and collects their input,the program will uses logic from what the user inputs to proform a give task.

## Project Requriements:
During each stage of this six week app development the client sent out weekly requriements that refactored the app to their needs. It was decided that week four would be the bases of what the app should contain with possibly adding to application after a review.

## Mini Project Week 4 client request:

Our app should use dictionaries for both product and courier. 
Building upon our use of a courier index within our order, let’s create a list of product indexes now for order items. 
We’ll also need to refactor our storage layer to use .csv files rather than .txt to bring back our persistence functionality. 
To show that our code works, we will also need to write unit tests to prove that our app works correctly. 
Goals As a user I want to: 
- create a product, courier, or order dictionary and add it to a list
- view all products, couriers, or orders
- update the status of an order 
- persist my data 
- STRETCH update or delete a product, order, or courier 
- BONUS list orders by status or courier 

>>>>>
## How does my code meet week 4 requirements:
My code has met week four requirements by refactoring storage layers to now use .csv files instead of .txt files 

@past image of screen shot of my code that shows files in csv

 - The app is able to view all products,couriers and orders once the user is within sub-menu and chooses option 1 from the menu
 - the user is able update the status of an order and i have also added a feature that will display the changes to the user
- The user is able to update or delete a product,order or courier and have this change be displayed back to them to show all changes.
I have also met week four goals by creating product,courier and order dictionary and added them to a list.during the creation of this application 
i have also consider the languge used to prompt user for their inputs and have used detail description where more information was needed.
I have implemented a simply colour system that will help to visually inhance the application for the user, these colors and fonts can be later manipulated to the clients desiers and in keeping with their drand identity which we know is extremly important accross all platforms.
 
## What could be improved:
 - after analsying my code, i would improve on writting less lines of code to perform a task. i would do this by refactoring my code 
using methods such as list comprehension ect.

## What i enjoyed implementing in this project:
- I really enjoyed implementing this whole project as it streached my knowledge ,pushed me to write better code, i also really enjoyed colaborating with team.
   writting functions and considering the flow of the applications.

## What would i implement if i had more time:
 - If i had more time i would implement unit test to ensure my code does work as intend, i would also update the stoarge from .csv to using sql
